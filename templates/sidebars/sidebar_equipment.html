        <strong>Purpose:</strong> This tab functions as the "Physical Constraint Engine." It provides the ground truth for the application's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) strategy. By mapping the vessel's finite inventory, including pharmaceuticals, equipment, and consumables, the system ensures that all generated advice is operationally relevant.

        This is the core of our Edge AI philosophy. The model is instructed to treat the inventory as a hard boundary. If a 27B model suggests a treatment, it must first validate the suggestion against the local inventory database. This eliminates the theoretical advice gap common in standard medical assistants and tailors the output to the vessel's specific capabilities.
