        When Logging is on the details of Triage and Inquiry chats 
        are saved here under each crew member's name. If Logging
        is off then the chats are not saved.<br><br>
        When you reactivate a past chat that chat is loaded into
        the Triage or Inquiry section and you can continue from where
        you last left-off. This is useful when you want to resubmit
        a chat for further consideration by the larger model.<br><br>
        When a crew member has not been selected for a chat the chat
        will be logged under Unnamed Crew as either Triage chat or
        an Inquiry chat.
